# Analysis, design and implementation of dierent Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architectures in the Field of image processing
This project was conducted during my studies as a team project, where we explored different GAN architectures and compared them. The architectures we investigated were Pix2Pix and CycleGAN. We trained our own GAN models using self-chosen datasets and compared the training approaches and results. A detailed analysis can be found in our report titled "main.pdf".
